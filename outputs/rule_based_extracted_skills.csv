"Team Lead, Machine Learning and Image Processing",SkyWatch,At SkyWatch  we believe that everyone on the planet should benefit from the thousands of satellites that orbit the earth. We are building a platform to put the world’s Earth observation data in one place — a simple API any developer can use. Our team of extraordinarily talented people has built a cutting-edge microservices platform on a serverless stack  and we’re growing fast.  OUR TEAM Let’s face it  the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.  Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers  Earth observation scientists  big data specialists  and unicorn startup veterans from places like Facebook  IBM  and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for startups  an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs  a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University  and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are Techstars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started   OUR CULTURE Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch  our culture is incredibly important to us  and we practice it every day. As a company  we value innovation  dependability  and accessibility. In our product  we value simplicity  affordability  and informability.  In engineering  we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First)  flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy)  and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).  Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk  we walk the walk.  OUR PRODUCT Every day  hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming  construction planning  disaster relief operations  and retail revenue prediction (to name a few)  the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However  the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.  While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially  we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved  is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.  Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software  we are building the SkyWatch API  a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops  predict the markets  track ships and airplanes  measure global warming  or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.  About the role and where do you fit? Great question   ABOUT YOU You enjoy being a player and a coach who is positive  supportive  trusting  and focused. You love helping people reach their potential.

You can tell a ten-year-old how an API works and not have them glaze over with boredom. Or a CEO. Or your significant other. OK  maybe not your significant other. You have a diverse background. Volunteer as a Big Sister? Founded a Meetup? Love to paint? Play a sport? We love diversity and value how much it adds to our team. You have a thirst for learning. We learn something every day. We find it intoxicating. If you’d rather master one thing and do that every day  this probably isn’t the role for you. You have thoughtful opinions that you feel comfortable sharing. We have a culture that makes sharing opinions safe. If everyone in a meeting always thinks the same way  we have too many people in that meeting. You have the ability to give more than you take. We have an incredible team. We want you to make it even better.  YOUR LEADERSHIP ARSENAL You are empathetic and believe in servant leadership. You have a strong background in software development best practices and embrace a culture that values an extensive test strategy. You have the ability to maximize resources and inspire. You see things as they are with a firm grasp on reality. You have vision and can see a future version of things where they are better. You’ve love building software and want to continue building applications with a hands-on approach.  YOUR TECHNICAL ARSENAL You can bounce between Python and Java and love building high performing reliable  high performing applications (bonus points for familiarity with distributed systems) You have experience with a broad range of geospatial and remote sensing technologies (such as GDAL or SNAP) and know how to create a normalized difference vegetation index. You believe in pragmatic ML and AI  and realize the model isn’t the product  but a way to make the product better. You can explain how a CNN works to a high school student. You love math and can articulate the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning in your own words. You understand the importance of code reviews and writing clean  maintainable code You believe in automated testing and can explain why it’s so important You’ve built software of some kind to solve a problem in your life outside of work. You have extensive experience on AWS  and get excited about their new product announcements. You’ve used git at the command line and have felt the pain of merge conflicts. You’ve secured an application and can articulate the value of differing security levels.  YOUR TYPICAL DAY 9:00 am — you sign on  catch up on Slack  email  system status  and important metrics. 10:00 am — you participate in our daily stand up  sharing what you did yesterday  what you plan on doing today  and if there are any roadblocks. 10:15 am — you pair-program with one of your teammates helping them push through a complex requirement. 12:00 pm — you get some fresh air or connect virtually with teammates for some social time. 1:00 pm — you put on the headphones and get dialed in to build a new microservice. 3:30 pm — happy with the code  you deploy to dev  and if tests pass  staging. 4:00 pm — you work together with other developers to lead a design session for a new feature  gathering thoughts  opinions  and lending your experience to the discussion. 5:00 pm — you wrap up unit tests  prep for deployment tomorrow  and disconnect for the day.

Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist,TerraSense Analytics Ltd,CATCHY INTRO Honestly  we’ve been brainstorming this “catchy intro” for about 20 minutes and everything that we throw at the wall is either too serious  or just downright lame  with no authenticity behind it.

You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours. These are hard requirements with no negotiation  so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements  but there is no wiggle room on this one. * QUALIFICATIONS* Excellent knowledge of Python 2 years of experience in building and shipping great software Experience with deploying ML on the edge or in the cloud Strong knowledge of ML frameworks (eg. TensorFlow  PyTorch  CUDA) Knowledge of computer vision models  frameworks  and tools Eligible for security clearance and to work in Canada Bonus: Experience with Docker  video analytics  and/or GUI development a plus Bonus: Networking and cybersecurity experience COMPENSATION Competitive salary and stock options based on experience  competency and length of service 5 weeks paid vacation Training and professional development allowance  and extended medical and dental Beer Tuesdays at our neighbourhood microbrewery (post Covid ) * NON - COMPENSATION CONSIDERATIONS* Accountability: We truly do work hard  play hard and expect everyone to self manage...meaning we don’t track hours.

Data Scientist,"Transit App
",Ridership is in flux. Uncertainty about “who’s riding” is at all-time highs. Transit agencies need real-time insights to understand what’s happening in their cities — and so do the companies and academic partners that serve them.  And then there’s Transit: Where are people booking trips? Where are folks headed? What modes are they taking? Transit network planners would weep at having the data you’ll have access to. You will be tasked with teasing meaning and insight out of all that data — from O-D matrices  to survey analysis — to help our agency and operator partners deliver better service on the ground  while also protecting user privacy with swords and dragons.  If your brain is wired for cities  if organizing data gives you a dopamine rush  and if improving one of the world’s most highly-used navigation apps would make you feel like a QUEEN at the end of each day  this job is for you. You’ll be trusted to reach elegant  simple conclusions from our big black box of user data  complemented by in-app and in-person research.  Responsibilities  You’ll draw insights from existing data sources  have input into the way we collect and structure our data  test all the hypotheses (okay not all the hypotheses)  create forecasts with that data  and talk data with our partners. You’ll design our in-app surveys and analyze the results. Since we’re not a giant company  you’ll get to determine how we package the data that partners care about — in a way that makes the most sense  and improves service.   ✅ Requirements You have a degree or hard-won experience in a quantitative field: stats  applied math  or econ — convince us it’s relevant. Bonus points for an advanced degree  lots of experience  and/or special projects you are legally sworn from talking about. Your portfolio of work shows you can make data sing in reality  not just in theory You’re always asking questions  and able to find something interesting in any dataset. SQL and noSQL queries that befuddle other mortals are  to you  mere child’s play. “Making sense of geospatial data is fun” — you. You have a facility for Python  R  other languages used in analyzing data. You can calculate the required sample size for statistical significance for a survey (perhaps you already have while reading this sentence…) and you can tell us why it’s not actually significant since it’s a convenience sample. You are an organized  analytical problem solver with strong written  oral and visual communication skills. Would be nice if… You have experience with data engineering  ETL. You can talk smack about modern machine learning techniques. You have experience turning out production-ready code. Passion for urbanism: you find cycling glamorous  you can navigate your city’s public transit system without a map  and you believe free parking should only ever exist on a Monopoly board. Even better: you’ve worked at a transit agency or private mobility provider  or have a degree in transportation.  Don’t feel like all the requirements apply to you but you still think you’d be a great fit for Transit? Don’t hesitate to apply    Compensation and benefits Competitive salary and stock options Comprehensive medical and dental coverage 5 weeks vacation Apple laptop and equipment $1 500 annual mobility allowance. STM? BIXI? Uber? E-bike? Scooter? Going car-free is free at Transit. A training and development budget Generous maternal/paternal/parental leave policy. Gotta fill out our tandem bicycles somehow  Flexible work hours Spend your days surrounded by first-rate teammates and the best view of Montreal Zoom backgrounds in the world ‍ A note on diversity  Public transit is used by overwhelmingly more women and people of colour than other modes of transportation. We try to make sure the diversity of our users is reflected in the team that serves them. Because when we include people of all races  genders  sexual orientations  ages  and identities — we end up building a better app for everyone who uses Transit.  We encourage candidates of all ages  genders  origins and orientations to apply. If you’d like to specify which pronouns you’d like to be referred to  feel free to include that in your application email.  And if your lived experience has given you a unique perspective on all things transportation  mobility  accessibility  urbanism?

Software Developer (Visual Machine Learning),IMSMB,We have a unique opportunity for someone who is smart  independent  and wants to tackle interesting technical challenges autonomously.  Our client  Xiris (https://www.xiris.com/)   specializes in using AI and machine learning to inspect fabricated metal: things like welded joints or 3D printed parts. When their clients are implementing a new manufacturing process  and need reliable technology to monitor and understand its success  they turn to Xiris.  Because the company is on the cutting edge of what software and cameras can do  there is always room to advance. With new camera technology becoming available  they’re looking to increase the capability and sophistication of our software.  We need your help to make that happen  As the new software developer  your work will focus specifically on welding inspection: finding tools and technology that will advance our AI detection and understanding of the welding process.
