This is a practical machine learning team, not a research team. Our goal is to deliver business value with machine learning and data in whatever form that takes.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

","The Company You'll Join

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

Automate monitoring of data distributions to detect and flag anomalies
Partner with product managers, engineers, and business teams to incorporate data-driven insights into decision-making

At peak usage, a million messages a minute passed through Slack.
During the week, our users spend over a billion minutes a day active in our product.

546,Software Developer (Visual Machine Learning),IMSMB,"We have a unique opportunity for someone who is smart, independent, and wants to tackle interesting technical challenges autonomously.

Our client, Xiris (https://www.xiris.com/) , specializes in using AI and machine learning to inspect fabricated metal: things like welded joints or 3D printed parts. When their clients are implementing a new manufacturing process, and need reliable technology to monitor and understand its success, they turn to Xiris.

Because the company is on the cutting edge of what software and cameras can do, there is always room to advance. With new camera technology becoming available, they’re looking to increase the capability and sophistication of our software.

We need your help to make that happen

As the new software developer, your work will focus specifically on welding inspection: finding tools and technology that will advance our AI detection and understanding of the welding process. The role will require significant expertise in implementing Machine Vision systems on real-time video data streams, using both conventional and AI techniques. Ultimately, this will be a leadership position that will drive our use of machine vision forward.

While much of your work will be independent, you will need to have both high communication skills and tolerance with ambiguity. Because our projects are niche and complex, there are not always ready-made solutions. As a result, your ability to communicate ideas effectively with fellow developers, and to iterate on project requirements as you learn more about the project scope, will be critical.

More specifically, you will:
Develop machine vision (MV) software components, and application-specific algorithms and tools, for use in larger software suites and programs developed by Xiris for inspection of welding processes
Apply MV technologies to many different use cases
Participate in every stage of the development cycle, from research to specification and production coding.
Maintain our current C++ SDK/toolkit which includes camera management and conventional machine vision tools (e.g., edge detection, blob analysis, morphology)
Provide technical and strategic guidance (and coding) to extend our toolkit to include AI and machine learning capabilities
Communicate with stakeholders and produce rapid prototypes to develop and propose solutions
Implement production-ready algorithms and tools in C++, in a lean and efficient manner within current corporate architectural frameworks, to solve specific inspection problems in the welding domain, using a combination of open source and custom code as appropriate
Interface with application designers to create useful and intuitive APIs
Propose and conduct research projects in MV, AI, ML and software architectures to ensure our software product is a world-class offering
The Stack: We use Visual Studio, VS Code, SVN, CMake, NuGet, targeting both Windows and Linux from a common code-base. And our cameras: CAVITAR, INTERTEST, MELT TOOLS

Working with Xiris

This is a full-time, permanent position with standard office hours Monday to Friday. In addition to a competitive salary you’ll receive benefits, incentive profit sharing, RRSP contributions, and at least 3 weeks’ vacation.

The team at Xiris has accomplished some amazing things despite being a small group of just 30 people: many of whom are long-term employees. That close-knit environment has been one of our strengths—we’ve proven that together, we are always up to the challenge.

Qualifications

8+ years’ experience in software development (a strong aptitude/background in Machine Vision projects/machine learning could reduce this to 5-6 years)
Substantial prior experience in low-level machine vision software development (such as post-graduate education and industrial experience) with a demonstrated portfolio of successful machine-vision system software development projects
Expertise in C++ architectural design and coding skills, including experience with Managed C++ (C++/CLI)
Experience with the application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning techniques to imaging and/or machine vision applications would be highly valuable
Substantial knowledge of open-source software in machine vision and/or imaging and/or signal processing would be ideal, e.g., OpenCV, CUDA
Some proficiency with Visual C# and/or Python
Exposure to industrial automation and/or automated inspection systems
Exposure to commercial MV toolkits
Experience with industrial cameras and related image processing techniques
How to Apply

Our online application will give you the option to apply to this role as a complete person – not just a resume. The application will assess your qualifications, personality traits and workplace preferences, and should take 10 to 15 minutes to complete. After submitting, you'll receive an email inviting you to log in and view your assessment results.

703,"Team Lead, Machine Learning and Image Processing",SkyWatch,"At SkyWatch, we believe that everyone on the planet should benefit from the thousands of satellites that orbit the earth. We are building a platform to put the world’s Earth observation data in one place — a simple API any developer can use. Our team of extraordinarily talented people has built a cutting-edge microservices platform on a serverless stack, and we’re growing fast.

OUR TEAM
Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for startups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are Techstars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!

OUR CULTURE
Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.

In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).

Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk, we walk the walk.

OUR PRODUCT
Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.

While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.

Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.

892,Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist,TerraSense Analytics Ltd,"CATCHY INTRO
Honestly, we’ve been brainstorming this “catchy intro” for about 20 minutes and everything that we throw at the wall is either too serious, or just downright lame, with no authenticity behind it. Which is absolutely hilarious, considering everyday TerraSense strives for authenticity. So that’s it. That’s what you get. Our not-so-super-catchy, not-super-lame, but not-super-corporate intro. Authentic. Hey, come work here and help us on this journey.
*
WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.
*
WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...*
... on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check. You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours. These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.

QUALIFICATIONS*
Excellent knowledge of Python
2 years of experience in building and shipping great software
Experience with deploying ML on the edge or in the cloud
Strong knowledge of ML frameworks (eg. TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA)
Knowledge of computer vision models, frameworks, and tools
