WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too.

That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree).

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
