18,"Team Lead, Machine Learning and Image Processing",None,"At SkyWatch, we believe that everyone on the planet should benefit from the thousands of satellites that orbit the earth. We are building a platform to put the world’s Earth observation data in one place — a simple API any developer can use. Our team of extraordinarily talented people has built a cutting-edge microservices platform on a serverless stack, and we’re growing fast.

OUR TEAM
Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for startups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are Techstars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!

OUR CULTURE
Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.

In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).

Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk, we walk the walk.

OUR PRODUCT
Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.

While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.

Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.

About the role and where do you fit? Great question!

ABOUT YOU
You enjoy being a player and a coach who is positive, supportive, trusting, and focused. You love helping people reach their potential.

You have a thirst for learning. We learn something every day. We find it intoxicating. If you’d rather master one thing and do that every day, this probably isn’t the role for you.
You have thoughtful opinions that you feel comfortable sharing. We have a culture that makes sharing opinions safe. If everyone in a meeting always thinks the same way, we have too many people in that meeting.
You have the ability to give more than you take. We have an incredible team. We want you to make it even better.

YOUR LEADERSHIP ARSENAL
You are empathetic and believe in servant leadership.
You have a strong background in software development best practices and embrace a culture that values an extensive test strategy.
You have the ability to maximize resources and inspire. You see things as they are with a firm grasp on reality.
You have vision and can see a future version of things where they are better.

149,Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist,None,"CATCHY INTRO

Honestly, we’ve been brainstorming this “catchy intro” for about 20 minutes and everything that we throw at the wall is either too serious, or just downright lame, with no authenticity behind it. Which is absolutely hilarious, considering everyday TerraSense strives for authenticity. So that’s it. That’s what you get. Our not-so-super-catchy, not-super-lame, but not-super-corporate intro. Authentic. Hey, come work here and help us on this journey.

WHY WORK WITH US?

Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.

WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...

... on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check. You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours. These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.

QUALIFICATIONS

Excellent knowledge of Python
2 years of experience in building and shipping great software
Experience with deploying ML on the edge or in the cloud
Strong knowledge of ML frameworks (eg. TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA)
Knowledge of computer vision models, frameworks, and tools
Eligible for security clearance and to work in Canada
Bonus: Experience with Docker, video analytics, and/or GUI development a plus

165,Data Scientist,None,"The Company You’ll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

Develop machine learning models to power new financial products and to extract trends from performance of existing products
Automate monitoring of data distributions to detect and flag anomalies
Partner with product managers, engineers, and business teams to incorporate data-driven insights into decision-making
Own, coordinate, and solve complex, cross-functional problems that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of product, analytics, and data science
The Impact You’ll Have
You will own significant projects directly aligning with Carta’s company-wide initiatives of data products and data quality. Your work will empower leaders across the company to make good product decisions and optimize operational efficiency. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to set best practices for integrating our ML models into production helping Carta’s current and future data scientists.
About You
Candidates must have a strong foundation in statistics, be proficient in SQL and Python, and have an analytical mindset. You have a strong bias towards simplicity, are excited by “zero to one” projects, and can efficiently communicate findings to leadership. Example traits that we value:
