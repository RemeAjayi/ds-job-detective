19,Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist,None,"CATCHY INTRO
Honestly, we’ve been brainstorming this “catchy intro” for about 20 minutes and everything that we throw at the wall is either too serious, or just downright lame, with no authenticity behind it. Which is absolutely hilarious, considering everyday TerraSense strives for authenticity. So that’s it. That’s what you get. Our not-so-super-catchy, not-super-lame, but not-super-corporate intro. Authentic. Hey, come work here and help us on this journey.

WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.

WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...*
... on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check. You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours.

30,Software Developer (Visual Machine Learning),None,"We have a unique opportunity for someone who is smart, independent, and wants to tackle interesting technical challenges autonomously.

Our client, Xiris (https://www.xiris.com/) , specializes in using AI and machine learning to inspect fabricated metal: things like welded joints or 3D printed parts. When their clients are implementing a new manufacturing process, and need reliable technology to monitor and understand its success, they turn to Xiris.

Because the company is on the cutting edge of what software and cameras can do, there is always room to advance. With new camera technology becoming available, they’re looking to increase the capability and sophistication of our software.

We need your help to make that happen

As the new software developer, your work will focus specifically on welding inspection: finding tools and technology that will advance our AI detection and understanding of the welding process. The role will require significant expertise in implementing Machine Vision systems on real-time video data streams, using both conventional and AI techniques. Ultimately, this will be a leadership position that will drive our use of machine vision forward.

While much of your work will be independent, you will need to have both high communication skills and tolerance with ambiguity. Because our projects are niche and complex, there are not always ready-made solutions. As a result, your ability to communicate ideas effectively with fellow developers, and to iterate on project requirements as you learn more about the project scope, will be critical.

More specifically, you will:
Develop machine vision (MV) software components, and application-specific algorithms and tools, for use in larger software suites and programs developed by Xiris for inspection of welding processes
Apply MV technologies to many different use cases
Participate in every stage of the development cycle, from research to specification and production coding.
Maintain our current C++ SDK/toolkit which includes camera management and conventional machine vision tools (e.g., edge detection, blob analysis, morphology)
Provide technical and strategic guidance (and coding) to extend our toolkit to include AI and machine learning capabilities
Communicate with stakeholders and produce rapid prototypes to develop and propose solutions
Implement production-ready algorithms and tools in C++, in a lean and efficient manner within current corporate architectural frameworks, to solve specific inspection problems in the welding domain, using a combination of open source and custom code as appropriate
Interface with application designers to create useful and intuitive APIs
Propose and conduct research projects in MV, AI, ML and software architectures to ensure our software product is a world-class offering
The Stack: We use Visual Studio, VS Code, SVN, CMake, NuGet, targeting both Windows and Linux from a common code-base. And our cameras: CAVITAR, INTERTEST, MELT TOOLS

Working with Xiris

This is a full-time, permanent position with standard office hours Monday to Friday. In addition to a competitive salary you’ll receive benefits, incentive profit sharing, RRSP contributions, and at least 3 weeks’ vacation.

The team at Xiris has accomplished some amazing things despite being a small group of just 30 people: many of whom are long-term employees. That close-knit environment has been one of our strengths—we’ve proven that together, we are always up to the challenge.

Qualifications

8+ years’ experience in software development (a strong aptitude/background in Machine Vision projects/machine learning could reduce this to 5-6 years)
Substantial prior experience in low-level machine vision software development (such as post-graduate education and industrial experience) with a demonstrated portfolio of successful machine-vision system software development projects
Expertise in C++ architectural design and coding skills, including experience with Managed C++ (C++/CLI)
Experience with the application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning techniques to imaging and/or machine vision applications would be highly valuable
Substantial knowledge of open-source software in machine vision and/or imaging and/or signal processing would be ideal, e.g., OpenCV, CUDA
Some proficiency with Visual C# and/or Python
Exposure to industrial automation and/or automated inspection systems
Exposure to commercial MV toolkits
Experience with industrial cameras and related image processing techniques

Our online application will give you the option to apply to this role as a complete person – not just a resume. The application will assess your qualifications, personality traits and workplace preferences, and should take 10 to 15 minutes to complete. After submitting, you'll receive an email inviting you to log in and view your assessment results.

We strive to build a team that reflects the diversity of the community we work in, and encourage applications from traditionally underrepresented groups such as women, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, people identifying as LGBTQ2SI, veterans, and people with disabilities.

116,"Team Lead, Machine Learning and Image Processing",None,"At SkyWatch, we believe that everyone on the planet should benefit from the thousands of satellites that orbit the earth. We are building a platform to put the world’s Earth observation data in one place — a simple API any developer can use. Our team of extraordinarily talented people has built a cutting-edge microservices platform on a serverless stack, and we’re growing fast.

OUR TEAM
Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for startups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are Techstars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!

OUR CULTURE
Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.

In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).

Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk, we walk the walk.

OUR PRODUCT
Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.

While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.

Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.

About the role and where do you fit? Great question!

ABOUT YOU

You have a diverse background. Volunteer as a Big Sister? Founded a Meetup? Love to paint? Play a sport? We love diversity and value how much it adds to our team.
You have a thirst for learning. We learn something every day. We find it intoxicating. If you’d rather master one thing and do that every day, this probably isn’t the role for you.
You have thoughtful opinions that you feel comfortable sharing. We have a culture that makes sharing opinions safe. If everyone in a meeting always thinks the same way, we have too many people in that meeting.
You have the ability to give more than you take. We have an incredible team. We want you to make it even better.

YOUR LEADERSHIP ARSENAL

You have a strong background in software development best practices and embrace a culture that values an extensive test strategy.

You have experience with a broad range of geospatial and remote sensing technologies (such as GDAL or SNAP) and know how to create a normalized difference vegetation index.
You believe in pragmatic ML and AI, and realize the model isn’t the product, but a way to make the product better.
You can explain how a CNN works to a high school student.
You love math and can articulate the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning in your own words.
You understand the importance of code reviews and writing clean, maintainable code
You believe in automated testing and can explain why it’s so important

You have extensive experience on AWS, and get excited about their new product announcements.
You’ve used git at the command line and have felt the pain of merge conflicts.
You’ve secured an application and can articulate the value of differing security levels.

YOUR TYPICAL DAY
9:00 am — you sign on, catch up on Slack, email, system status, and important metrics.
10:00 am — you participate in our daily stand up, sharing what you did yesterday, what you plan on doing today, and if there are any roadblocks.
