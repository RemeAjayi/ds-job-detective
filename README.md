# Data Science Job Detective

<!-- Add buttons here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
Getting your dream Data Science Job is a great motivation for developing a Data Science Roadmap. How do you develop a Roadmap without knowing the relevant skills and tools to Learn. In this project, I will explore over 800 Data Science Job postings in Canada. The data used was collected from postings on Glassdoor and Indeed in early June, 2021.


# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->
You can find the [Demo](https://share.streamlit.io/remeajayi/ds-job-detective/main/deploy.py) here.
